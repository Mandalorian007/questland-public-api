# Questland API
This is a public API for Questland inspired by Mandalorian007. 
Current public url: https://questland-public-api.cfapps.io/swagger-ui.html

# Purpose
Help the community build and grow. I offer informative videos on my
YouTube to help players catch up with ease to enjoy the game and
published a "handbook" that offers guides on everything you need
to know! I have also created a questland discord bot that is backed by
the questland public api. To earn exclusive perks become a Patreon by pledging
$3 or more, though it's not required, but greatly appreciated.

# Youtube
My youtube provides the basics such as Gear, a variety of builds,
and the Battle Events.
